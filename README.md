# flutter_development
This is my track of learning flutter.


I'll be updating files daily with updated code.

-------------------------------------------------xx----------------------------xx-----------------------------------


Date: 29/06/2022 ==> Today I released my first ever flutter build accessible at: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/First_Flutter_Build

Do visit!!! 

From Today onwards the current Lib folder: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/flutter_development/tree/main/lib 
won't be updated you can access the complete code for use.

I've created new folder namely Expense Planner Code Files
Link: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/flutter_development/tree/main/Expense%20Planner%20Code%20Files/lib

The folder will contain code files of my new project Expense Planner app/website using flutter. 
Once the app/website would be completely build I'll release the repository with apk and website link.
