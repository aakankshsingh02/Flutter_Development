# flutter_development
This is my track of learning flutter.


I'll be updating files daily with updated code.


Date: 29/06/2022 ==> Today I released my first ever flutter build accessible at: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/First_Flutter_Build

Do visit!!! 

From Today onwards the current Lib folder: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/flutter_development/tree/main/lib 
won't be updated you can access the complete code for use.


I've created new folder namely 
Expense Planner Code Files: https://github.com/aakankshsingh02/flutter_development/tree/main/Expense%20Planner%20Code%20Files/lib

Which will contain code files of my new project Expense Planner app/website using flutter. 
Once the app would be completely build I'll release the app repository with apk.


I'll be adding new files from tomorrow showing my progress.
